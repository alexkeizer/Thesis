Although the implementation is far from complete, and a lot more work is required to improve the ergonomics of (co)recursive functions, this thesis hopes to contribute to making coinductive types available in Lean, with strong support for mixed induction, coinduction, and quotients. 

In particular, I designed a procedure that compiles definitional specifications of (co)dataypes
that arbitrarily nest induction, coinduction, and quotients into constructions on quotients of polynomial functors that define the desired type.

This procedure was built upon a pre-existing formalization of QPFs, but first,
this formalization had to be ported from Lean 3 to Lean 4. I am also in the process of making
these ported formalizations available as part of the mathlib4 project, the port of Leans community-maintained, comprehensive mathematics library.

Finally, a prototype implementation was developed as a Lean library, making extensive use of its meta-programming system.
This library enables users to write (co)datatype specifications with the full expressive power of QPFs using the
same syntax as Leans standard \inductive{} type specifications.
