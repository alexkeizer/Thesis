\chapter{Background}
\label{ch:background}

A key concept for the rest of this thesis will be QPF (Quotient of Polynomial Functor), and how we can use them to encode (co)inductive types. The current chapter serves to illuminate this notion, and explain relevant parts of the Lean system along the way.

We will assume as little background knowledge as possible, yet, some (minimal) exposure to category theory and functional programming concepts will be beneficial to understanding. Readers can find references at \cite{awodeyCategoryTheory2010, milewskiCategoryTheoryProgrammers} for category theory and \cite{christiansenFunctionalProgrammingLean} for functional programming.

%     Add references for FP, maybe The Little Typer?
% \end{todo}

\begin{remark}
    We will use remarks like this one below code snippets to explain Lean syntax and concepts that might not be familiar. We don't assume any knowledge of Lean, but the interested reader is invited to consult the online documentation, or ``Functional Programming in Lean'' for a more comprehensive introduction
    \cite{avigadTheoremProvingLean,christiansenFunctionalProgrammingLean}.
\end{remark}



The encoding of types as QPFs relies on a key observation; a lot of types are functorial in nature.
Take, for example, the inductive type of lists, specified as
\begin{leancode}
    inductive List (α : Type)
    | nil  : List α
    | cons : α → List α → List α
\end{leancode}

This defines a function \lean{List} that takes a type, α, and returns a new type, whose elements represent lists of α.
We call such functions \emph{type functions}. Note that we mean function here in a very concrete sense.

\section{Types are Terms \& Type Universes}
In a dependently typed language, such as Lean, types \emph{are} terms. In particular, things like \lean{Nat} and \lean{String} are types, but they are also \emph{values} of type \Type.
The signature of \lean{List}, then, is \leanm{Type → Type}, just like the signature of, e.g., \lean{Nat.add} (binary addition of natural numbers) is \leanm{Nat → Nat → Nat}.

\begin{remark}
    We also write \leanm{f : α → β} to say ``\lean{f} has type \leanm{α → β}'', meaning that \lean{f} is a function from type \lean{α} to type \lean{β}.
\end{remark}

We call \Type{} a \emph{type universe}, i.e., a type whose elements are themselves types. However, \Type{} is again also a value, which needs be of some type.
It cannot be the case that \leanm{Type : Type}; this leads to Girard's paradox, which is the type theory analogue of Russel's Paradox \cite{girardInterpretationFonctionelleElimination1972}.

Instead, there Lean has an infinite sequence of increasing type universes, so that \leanm{Type : Type 1}, \leanm{Type 1 : Type 2}, and in general, \leanm{Type u : Type (u+1)}. In fact, \leanm{Type} is just a shorthand for \leanm{Type 0}, the smallest type universe.

Universe levels \lean{u} are essentially natural numbers, but they are \textbf{not} first class values, and are indeed very different from elements of \leanm{Nat}.
In particular, when writing \Typen{u}, the universe \lean{u} is \textbf{not} a regular term. There is a separate grammar, with some minimal builtin operations, that defines valid universe levels.

It is possible, and indeed common to be generic over the universe of some type parameter. For example, the actual, \emph{universe polymorphic} definition of lists specifies that the parameter \lean{α} should live in \lean{Type u}.
\begin{leancode}
    inductive List (α : Type u)
    | nil  : List α
    | cons : α → List α → List α
\end{leancode}

Then the signature of \lean{List} becomes \leanm{Type u → Type u}, for any universe level \lean{u}.

\section{Functoriality of type functions}

Returning to our discussion of \lean{List}, there is also an obvious mapping function that lifts a function \lean{f : α → β}, for arbitrary types \lean{α} and \lean{β}, to a function \lean{List α → List β}, by applying \lean{f} to each element of the argument list. Its signature is written as:
\begin{center}
    \leanm{map : (f : α → β) → List α → List β}
\end{center}

\begin{remark}
    If a function takes multiple arguments, it is idiomatic to write them in a \emph{curried} style,
    so \leanm{f : α → β → γ} says that \lean{f} is a function that takes two arguments, an \lean{α} and a \lean{β}, to produce a \lean{γ}. Arrows are right-associative.

    Furthermore, \leanm{(a : α) → β} is a \emph{dependent} arrow; it is a function from \lean{α} to \lean{β}, with the possibility to make the resulting type depend on the \emph{value} \lean{a} of the first argument. 
    We used this syntax in the definition of \lean{map} above, even though it is a regular, non-dependent function, just to give a name to the first argument. 
    It would have been equivalent to write \leanm{map : (α → β) → List α → List β}.

    Notice also that, as \lean{α} and \lean{β} range over all types, they are thus actually also arguments to \lean{map}. Since the value of \lean{α} and \lean{β} can be inferred from the other arguments, though, there is no need to supply values for them when calling \lean{map}, hence, they can be implicit arguments. 
    
    It is possible to explicitly define implicit arguments, using curly brackets \lean{\{...\}}.
    \begin{center}
    \leanm{map: {α β : Type u} → (α → β) → List α → List β}
    \end{center}
    However, Lean will automatically add such implicit binders for free variables, so long as it can infer which type it should have --- this feature is called ``auto bound implicits''. 
    We generally won't write these implicit binders, instead adopting the convention that \lean{α} and \lean{β} refer to types.
\end{remark}

Together, a type function \leanm{F : Type u → Type v} and a mapping operation \lean{map : (f: α → β) → F α → F β} form a \emph{functor}, so long as they preserve: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Identity maps}, that is, \lean{F (id α) = id (F α)}, with \lean{id β} the identity function on arbitrary types \lean{β}, and
    \item \emph{Compositions}, that is, \lean{(map f) ∘ (map g) = map (f ∘ g)}, where \lean{∘} denotes function composition
\end{itemize}
\lean{List α} is an example of a functor, but so are, e.g., products (\lean{α × β}) and sums 
(\lean{α ⊕ β}).

A function \lean{f : F α → α}, for some fixed type \lean{α}, is called an \emph{\lean{F}-algebra}; inductive types correspond to an \emph{initial} such algebra. To clarify, an \lean{F}-algebra \lean{f} is initial, if for every \lean{F}-algebra \lean{g} there is exactly one arrow \lean{rec} that makes the square of \cref{fig:initial_alg_square} commute.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{todo}
    initial algebra commuting square
\end{todo}

\caption{Commuting square for initial $F$-algebras $f : F(α) → α$}
\label{fig:initial_alg_square}
\end{figure}

Consider the type of natural numbers, \lean{Nat}; we'll show that the constructors for \lean{Nat} 
Consider a functor ${F_{nat}(α) = \lean{Unit} \mathop{⊕} α}$, where \lean{Unit} is the unit type --- with \lean{unit} as its sole inhabitant --- and \lean{⊕} denotes a sum (disjoint union). On functions $f : α → β$, the obvious choice of mapping operation $F(f) : F(α) → F(β)$ is such that $F(f)(\lean{unit}) = \lean{unit}$ and $F(f)(a) = f(a)$ for all $a : α$.

Natural numbers are defined by the constant $0 ∈ \mathbb{N}$ and the function $succ : \mathbb{N} → \mathbb{N}$. Together, these constructors give an algebra $f : F_{nat}(\mathbb{N}) → \mathbb{N}$. 

Let $g : F_{nat}(α) → α$ be an arbitrary $F$-algebra, and define a function $\mathrm{rec} : \mathbb{N} → α$ such that $\mathrm{rec}(0) = g(\lean{unit})$ and  $\mathrm{rec}(n+1) = \mathrm{rec}(g(n))$, for every $n ∈ \mathbb{N}$.

The inductive properties of \lean{Nat} are exactly what makes this algebra initial.

Dually, there is a connection between coinductive types and final coalgebras.
Not all functors, though, have initial algebras, or final coalgebras.
% And, it is not, in general, easy to construct such (co)algebras.


\section{Polynomial functors}
Of special interest are \emph{polynomial functors}, which, intuitively, can be composed from a few primitive operations (such as constants, sums, products and exponentials).
More formally, we say that a polynomial functor is defined by a set $A$ and an $A$-indexed family of sets $B_a$ as
\[
    P(X) = \Sigma_{a ∈ A} B_a \rightarrow X  
\]
That is, $P(X)$ is the disjoint union of all functions from $B_a$ to $X$, for every $a ∈ A$.
In the theory, we generally still refer to functors that are not defined in this form, but are isomorphic to a polynomial functor in the strict sense, as polynomial.

To encode this in Lean, we replace ``set'' with ``type'' and obtain the following.
\footnote{To remain consistent, we will use Lean 4 syntax and naming conventions throughout the whole thesis, even though we are still discussing the formalizations as established by Avigad et al here. The difference with the Lean definitions presented in this chapter, and those presented in their original work are superficial.}
\begin{leancode}
    structure PFunctor := (A : Type) (B : A → Type)
\end{leancode}

\begin{remark}
    \leanm{structure} is a simple wrapper around \inductive, for when there is only one constructor.
    The above is equivalent to
    \begin{leancode}
        inductive PFunctor 
        | mk : (A : Type) → (B : A → Type) → PFunctor
    \end{leancode}
\end{remark}

Then, the operations on types and functions are straightforward
\begin{leancode}
    /-- Applying `P` to an object of `Type` -/
    def PFunctor.Obj (P : PFunctor) (α : Type)
        := Σ x : P.A, P.B x → α

    /-- Applying `P` to a morphism of `Type` -/
    def PFunctor.map (P : PFunctor) (f : α → β) : P.Obj α → P.Obj β 
        := fun ⟨a, g⟩ => ⟨a, f ∘ g⟩
\end{leancode}

\begin{remark}
    Variable \lean{P} is known to be of type \lean{PFunctor}, so \lean{P.Obj} is recognized as \lean{PFunctor.Obj P}. Similarly, as \lean{PFunctor} has only one constructor, \lean{PFunctor.mk}, the anonymous constructor syntax \lean{⟨a, g⟩} is translated to \lean{PFunctor.mk a g}.
    Finally, \leanm{fun ⟨a, g⟩ => _} defines a function that takes a single argument \lean{x : P.Obj α}, and immediately deconstructs it into the constituent elements \lean{a : P.A} and \lean{g : P.B a → α}.
\end{remark}

So an element of \lean{P.Obj α} is a (dependent) pair of a \emph{shape} $a ∈ A$ and a function $g : B_a \rightarrow \alpha$, representing the \emph{contents}. A mapped function \lean{P.map f} then leaves the shape as is, and precomposes $f$ with the content $g$.

\subsection*{W-types}
We already saw that inductive types are freely generated by the constructors. In a sense, an element of, e.g., \lean{Nat} is a well-founded (i.e., finite) tree with two kinds of nodes: \lean{zero} nodes are leaves, and \lean{succ} nodes have exactly one child.

The \emph{W-type} of a polynomial functor \lean{P} is the type of exactly such trees: shapes $a ∈ A$ distinguish different kind of nodes, and the cardinality of $B_a$ determines the number of children nodes of type $a$ have. Such trees are easily encoded by an \inductive{} type.

\begin{leancode}
    inductive W (P : PFunctor)
    | mk (a : P.A) (f : P.B a → W P) : W P
\end{leancode}

By construction, the W-type is the initial algebra of \lean{P}.

It is important to make a distinction between types that \emph{are} polynomial functor, and types that are (equivalent to) W-types \emph{of} polynomial functors. 
For example, \lean{Nat} is not a polynomial functor, but it \emph{is} the W-type of a polynomial functor (namely, \lean{F$_\lean{nat}$}). 

Conversely, \lean{List} is both. It is a polynomial functor: take $A = \mathbb{N}$ and $B_n = \{0,..,n-1\}$, then a list of $n$ elements is encoded as a pair with shape $n$, and content $f : \{0,..,n-i\}$ mapping each $i < n$ to the $i$-th element of the list. 
Simultaneously, \lean{List α}, for every \lean{α} is also the W-type of a \emph{different} polynomial functor, defined by $A = \texttt{Unit} ⊕ α$, where $B$ of the unit value is the empty type and $B_a = \lean{Unit}$ for every $a : α$. The W-type of this polynomial functor consists of trees where leaves represent the empty list, and internal nodes are labelled with an element of type \lean{α} (the head of the list) and have exactly one subtree (the tail of the list).

\subsection*{M-types}
Coinductive types are similar, except that the trees they are represented by may be of infinite depth. Encoding these in Lean is quite a bit more involved.

An \emph{M-type} of a polynomial functor \lean{P} is the type of potentially infinite depth trees, where shapes $a ∈ A$ distinguish different kind of nodes, and the cardinality of $B_a$ determines the number of children nodes of type $a$ have.

An \emph{approximation} of an M-type up to depth $n$ is the type of such trees of height at most $n$, where any required subtrees at depth $n+1$ are replaced with a special ``continue'' leaf. 

\begin{leancode}
  inductive MApprox (P : PFunctor) : Nat → Type u
  | continu : MApprox 0
  | intro {n} : (a : P.A) → (P.B a → MAprrox P n) → MAprrox P (succ n)
\end{leancode}

Then, we define what it means for approximations \emph{agree} --- either the first approximation must be a ``continue'' leaf, or both approximations have nodes of the same kind as root, and the corresponding subtrees recursively agree --- whence an M-type is just an infinite series of approximations of increasing depth where every approximation agrees with the next.

\begin{leancode}
  inductive Agree : ∀ {n : Nat}, MApprox P n → MApprox P (n + 1) → Prop
  | continu (x : MApprox P 0) (y : MApprox P 1) : Agree x y
  | intro {n} {a}   (x  : F.B a → MApprox P n) 
                    (x' : F.B a → MApprox P (n + 1)) 
                    : (∀ i : F.B a, Agree (x i) (x' i))
                    → Agree (MApprox.intro a x) (MApprox.intro a x')

  structure M := 
    (approx : ∀ n, MApprox P n) (consistent : ∀ n, Agree (approx n) (approx (n+1)))
\end{leancode}

The M-type of a polynomial functor is, by construction, its final coalgebra.

\begin{todo}
    % \subsection*{Fixpoints}      

    Clarify fixpoints?

    Recall that (co)inductive types are represented by initial algebras and final coalgebras. The M and W-types of a polynomial functor are exactly such (co)algebras. Thus, defining a polynomial functor also defines a freely generated inductive and coinductive type.

\end{todo}

\section{Quotients}
Lean does not just have \inductive{} types, it also supports quotients of types. For example, it is common to define a multiset as the quotient of lists through the relation that equates lists up to permutation.

%LEANIGNORE
\begin{leancode}
    /-- `List.perm as bs` holds iff `as` is a permutation of `bs` -/
    def List.perm : List α → List α → Prop

    def Multiset α := Quot (@List.perm α)
\end{leancode}

This presents a problem, since quotients cannot be represented by just polynomial functors. Thus, generalize to \emph{quotients} of polynomial functors.

Intuitively, a functor \lean{F} is the quotient of some polynomial functor \lean{P} when, for every \lean{α}, there is a surjective \emph{natural transformation} \lean{abs} from \lean{P.Obj α} to \lean{F α}. We can think of \lean{abs} as mapping abstract objects in \lean{F α} to their concrete representations in \lean{P.Obj α}.

Recall that every functor \lean{F} is equipped with a mapping operation \lean{map} on functions \lean{f : α → β}. To say that \lean{abs} is a natural transformation is to say that it respects this functorial structure. That is to say, the following square should commute:
\begin{todo}
    Commuting square: (see .tex source)

    P α -- P.map f --> P β
     |                  |
     | abs α            | abs β
     |                  |
     \/                 \/
    F α -- map\_F f --> F β 

\end{todo}

Formally, we can show that \lean{abs} is surjective by providing, for every \lean{α}, a function \lean{repr: F α → P.Obj α} and proving that it is a right-inverse.
This is specified in Lean with the \lean{QPF} typeclass.
\begin{leancode}
  class Qpf (F : Type → Type) [Functor F] where
    P        : PFunctor
    abs      : ∀ {α}, P.Obj α → F α
    repr     : ∀ {α}, F α → P.Obj α
    abs_repr : ∀ {α} (x : F α), abs (repr x) = x
    abs_map  : ∀ {α β} (f : α → β) (p : P.Obj α), 
                    abs (f <$> p) = f <$> abs p
\end{leancode}
Where \lean{f <\$> x} is Lean syntax for applying \lean{map$_\texttt{G}$ f} to \lean{x} --- the functor \lean{G} is inferred from the type of \lean{x}.


\subsection*{Compositionality}

This thesis is mostly focussed on (co)datatypes, we don't provide any facilities to help with defining QPF-based quotient types. 
Still, we do maintain full compositionality, even more so than Lean's native notions of \inductive{} and quotient types.

For example, recall the \lean{Multiset} quotient type. One might want to use it to define the type of well-founded, unordered trees.
\begin{badleancode}
  inductive UnorderedTree α
  | node : α → Multiset (UnorderedTree α) → UnorderedTree α
\end{badleancode}

Lean rejects this; it is not allowed to nest recursive occurences of \lean{UnorderedTree} behind a quotient type.

On the other hand, if we (manually) define \lean{Multiset} as a QPF with the same semantics, then we can freely compose it in (co)datatype specifications.
\begin{leancode}
  data UnorderedTree α
  | node : α → Multiset (UnorderedTree α) → UnorderedTree α
\end{leancode}


\begin{todo}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Multiset example
        \item Impossible with pfunctor
        \item Show QPF definition (univariate, without universes)
        \item Note that we don't specifically look at quotients in the rest of the thesis, but we do do \data{} and \codata{} constructions as QPFs, which compose well. Still, the current implementation breaks when trying to use quotients. (reference limitations section)
    \end{itemize}
\end{todo}











\section{Type Universes}
\label{sec:bg:universes}

A big strength of Lean is that it treats types as first class. Just like \lean{0} is a value of type \lean{Nat}, the type \lean{Nat} is itself a \emph{value}, of type \Type{} (the ``type of types''). Because types are also values, \Type{} needs a type to live in as well. Setting \leanm{(Type: Type)} would lead to unsoundness, so instead, there is a notion of \emph{type universes}. We have that \leanm{Type : Type 1}, \leanm{Type 1 : Type 2}, and in general, \leanm{Type u : Type (u+1)}. In fact, \leanm{Type} is just a shorthand for \leanm{Type 0}, the smallest type universe.

Universe levels are essentially natural numbers, but they are \textbf{not} first class values, and are indeed very different from elements of \leanm{Nat}.
In particular, when writing \Typen{u}, the universe \lean{u} is \textbf{not} a normal term, there is a separate grammar, with some minimal builtin operations, that defines valid universe levels.

We \emph{can} make our definitions generic over which universe to work in, this is called \emph{universe polymorphism}. The polymorphic definition of a polynomial functor looks like
\begin{leancode}
    universe u

    structure PFunctor := (A : Type u) (B : A → Type u)
\end{leancode}
Where the first command declares that \lean{u} is a universe variable in subsequent definitions.
When referring to \lean{PFunctor}, we can specify a universe to work in by writing \lean{PFunctor.\{u\}}. A similar syntax also introduces a universe variable that is local to a single definition.

\begin{leancode}
    def PFunctor.Obj.{v} (P : PFunctor.{v}) (α : Type v)
        := Σ x : P.A, P.B x → α
\end{leancode}

Note that usually we don't have to be this explicit. Lean will usually infer the right universe levels, when left unspecified.
For example, with \lean{map} as before, Lean recognizes that (with the new definition of \lean{PFunctor}) the implicit arguments \lean{α} and \lean{β} live in \Typen{u} and that \lean{P} is a \lean{PFunctor.\{u\}}, for some universe variable \lean{u}.
\begin{leancode}
    def PFunctor.map (P : PFunctor) (f : α → β) : P.Obj α → P.Obj β 
        := fun ⟨a, g⟩ => ⟨a, f ∘ g⟩    
\end{leancode}

The other constructions are easily made universe polymorphic as well.








\section{Multivariate Functors}
\label{sec:mvfunctor}

Earlier, we mentioned that sums and products (written as \lean{α ⊕ β} and \lean{α × β}, respectively, in Lean) are functorial in both arguments.
They are, in fact, polynomial, but, both take two types as arguments and don't fit in the definitions presented so far. We have to generalize from the univariate case to \emph{multivariate} functors.

It is difficult to reason about $n$-ary curried functions, where $n$ is arbitrary, so instead we use the following, \emph{uncurried} representation of multivariate, universe polymorphic, type functions.

\begin{leancode}
    def TypeFun (n : Nat) := (TypeVec.{u} n) → Type v
\end{leancode}
Where \lean{TypeVec} is a \emph{type vector}, i.e., a list of exactly $n$ elements of \Typen{u}.
We define such vectors as a map from a canonical finite type \lean{Fin2 n}, which has exactly $n$ inhabitants.
\begin{leancode}
    def TypeVec (n : Nat) := (i : Fin2 n) → Type u
\end{leancode}
Notice that all arguments to a \lean{TypeFun} live in the same universe $u$, and the result lives in a potentially different universe $v$. 
Most constructions do require that these universes coincide, and use \lean{TypeFun.\{u,u\}}.

Suppose that \lean{Sum'} is the uncurried version of sums, then we would write \lean{Sum' ![α₁, α₂]} to use it with argument types α₁ and α₂ The \lean{map} operation now takes not one function, but a vector (i.e., list of known size) of $n$ functions, each going from \lean{αᵢ} to \lean{βᵢ}. The type of such vectors of functions is written, e.g, \lean{![α₁, α₂] ⟹ ![β₁, β₂]} (when $n=2$).

\begin{leancode}
    map : {v₁ v₂ : TypeVec n} → (v₁ ⟹ v₂) → F v₁ → F v₂
\end{leancode}
\begin{remark}
    Objects of type \lean{TypeVec n}, for some fixed but arbitrary length $n$, and morphisms \leanm{(⋅ ⟹ ⋅)} form a category. 
    Multivariate type functors are in fact nothing more than (univariate) functors on this category of type vectors.
\end{remark}

Thus, if \lean{f₁ : α₁ → β₁} and \lean{f₂ : α₂ → β₂}, then \lean{Sum'.map ![f₁, f₂]} yields a function from \lean{Sum' ![α₁, α₂]} to \lean{Sum' ![β₁, β₂]}.
The functoriality constraints have an obvious generalization to the multivariate case.

\subsection{Multivariate Polynomial Functors}
An $n$-ary, polynomial functor is still defined with a shape $A$ as before, but the content now maps $a ∈ A$ not to a single type, but to a vector of $n$ types.

\begin{leancode}
    structure MvPFunctor (n : Nat) := (A : Type u) (B : A → TypeVec.{u} n)
\end{leancode}

The generalization proceeds relatively straightforwardly.
\begin{leancode}
    def MvPFunctor.Obj (P : MvPFunctor.{u} n) : TypeFun.{u,u} n
        := fun (α : TypeVec n) => Σ a : P.A, P.B a ⟹ α

    def MvPFunctor.map  (P : MvPFunctor.{u} n) 
                        (f : v₀ ⟹ v₁) 
                            : P.Obj v₀ → P.Obj v₁ 
        := fun ⟨a, g⟩ => ⟨a, TypeVec.comp f g⟩
\end{leancode}

Where \lean{TypeVec.comp} is the pointwise composition of two vectors of functions.

\begin{remark}
    Implicit variables are not limited to types, we will use \lean{n} and \lean{m} for natural numbers and \lean{v₀, v₁, ...} for type vectors.
\end{remark}

The generalization of M and W-types to the multivariate case is left as an exercise for the reader.

\subsection{Multivariate QPFs}

    List the full definition of MvQpf with universes
\end{todo}


\section{Inductive Families}
\label{sec:ind_families}

It is important to clarify that we're only considering inductive \emph{types}, 
for which the recursive occurrences of the type being declared must not use other values for the type parameters. Lean also has inductive \emph{families} of types for which this restriction does not hold.

Consider, for example, \lean{Fin2}, the type of natural numbers less than $n$.
\begin{badleancode}
    inductive BadFin2 (n : Nat)
    | fz : BadFin2 (n+1)
    | fs : BadFin2 n → BadFin2 (n+1)
\end{badleancode}

This won't compile, because this defines an inductive type, and the constructors mention \lean{BadFin2 (n+1)}, while they are only allowed to mention \lean{BadFin2 n}.

The syntax for an inductive family is very similar; we can promote \lean{n} from parameter to \emph{index} by removing the binder, and giving a type signature.

\begin{leancode}
    inductive Fin2 : Nat → Type
    | fz : Fin2 (n+1)
    | fs : Fin2 n → Fin2 (n+1)
\end{leancode}

Inductive families do not correspond to initial algebras in the same way that inductive types do, and the constructions as QPFs \emph{fundamentally} don't support inductive families, nor the coinductive analogue.
Hence, we shall limit ourselves to just (co)inductive types.
